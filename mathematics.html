            It gives me immense pleasure to invite you to the School of Basic Science. The school proposes to offer Bachelors, Masters and Ph.D programs in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics , Geography and Information Technology  in order to nurture young minds towards scientific challenges. We aim and are committed to impart quality education in order to enhance students interest towards basic sciences. Our School plays a vital role in teaching basic sciences courses as prescribed by the curriculum of the University Campus as per National Education Policy (NEP-2020).

We also try to fascinate student experience in a research environment with an eye on current day technology applications. Students are given the best opportunity to expose themselves towards collaborative research across various disciplines for their academic growth. Initiatives have been taken to get them the opportunity to avail national and international internship/scholarships. Regular seminars/workshops, conferences etc. by scientific and industrial researchers at national and international level cultivate interest towards current research in the scientific fields.  The intense attention and rigorous training in all academic pursuits prepares them for competing at the global level.

In realizing the vision of development of high quality education and research, the School of Basic Sciences consisted of dedicated faculty members.  Their aim is to train young minds and prepare them for future scientific goals. The teaching module adopted in classroom teaching comprises lectures, tutorials and practicals is based on the application of innovation strategies and strictly followed by an active interaction between teachers and students.

Therefore, the School of Basic Sciences takes an active incentive to develop a perfect approach to improve students’ competence of visualizing scientific strands and inspire them to handle intricate challenges that lie at the confluence of science and technology.

        <h1 style = "color:#d00000ff">About the Department</h1>
        <p>The Physics department is an important part of the School of Basic Sciences, UIET at the CSJM University, Kanpur. This department was established in 1996. The department has seven accomplished, motivated and dedicated faculty members with credible expertise in various research areas such as High Energy Particle Physics, Optoelectronics and Fibre Optics, Solid State Physics and Amorphous Semiconductor Physics. The department also has two assisting staff members for the Laboratory. Physics Department offering UG, PG and Ph.D. Programme such as B.Sc. (Hons.), B.Sc. in different combinations with physics, M.Sc. (Physics), Doctorate in different research areas.

            Role of Physics in Engineering Disciplines
            Engineering arises from the practical application of the ideas originating from Physical Sciences. Hence a strong foundation in Physical Sciences is an essential criteria for any branch of engineering. The subject of Physics being one of the most important constituents of the Physical Sciences is thus a key pre requisite for pursuing any branch of engineering.</p>

                Welcome to the Department of Mathematics.  It is noted in the Vedanga Jyotisha  ( c. 500 BC) that

                यथा शिखा मयूराणां नागानां मणयो यथा ।
                तद्वत् वेदाङ्गशास्त्राणां गणितं मूर्धनि स्थितम् ॥
                
                Like the crest of the peacock, like the gem on the head of a snake, so is mathematics at the head of all knowledge.  It is no wonder that there exists no branch of science devoid of Mathematics. That is why Carl Friedrich Gauss rightly said, “Mathematics is the queen of all sciences.
                
                Department of Mathematics of CSJM University, Kanpur started functioning in 1996. The Department of mathematics aims at educating students who are adorned with academic and modern knowledge of technology, who perceive continuous development as way of life, who can think creatively and critically, who are prone to team work, and who have acquired ethical responsibility and business ethics. Moreover; its purpose is to raise individuals who have the skills to define, model, and produce a solution method and make decision-making skills in the fields related to science and engineering. Our Department provides a comprehensive curriculum that covers different aspects of mathematics and various stream of study to cater to the diverse career goals the students may have.
                
                I invite you to browse our website to learn more about our curriculum and streams of study.
