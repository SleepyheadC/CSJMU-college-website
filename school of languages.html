        <p>The Department of English and Modern European and Other Foreign Languages, formerly Department of English (Campus), is an aided department established in 1981. Initially the Department offered MPhil and PhD courses. Since 1991 onwards, MA in English Language and Literature [Annual Exam System) was introduced. MPhil (English) was being run by the Department till 2017. The University Grants Commission abolished the course after this period. From July 2021 onwards, the Department has come to be known as the Department of English and Modern European and Other Foreign Languages under School of Languages, CSJM University (Campus) Kanpur. The Department has started BA (Hons.) Semester System and introduced Semester System in MA (English Literature).

            English has evolved into being the lingua franca in contemporary times. The legacy of English Literature continues to cater to the sensibilities of avid readers. While globally, efforts are being made to revive and recreate literatures in vernacular languages, English is also making ardent efforts to make available World Literature through mechanisms of translation. We invite you at Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University to explore English Literature, which today assimilates voices from various geo-political locations, ensuring greater inclusivity and egalitarianism. It is our constant endeavour to sensitize young minds to contemporary debates, alongside instilling in them a taste to relish and appreciate literary works.</p>
